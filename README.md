# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python-based game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the game will give feedback on whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

## Features
- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player guesses the number by inputting their guesses.
- After each guess, the program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The program tracks the number of attempts made to guess the number.
- If the player inputs an invalid value (non-numeric), the game prompts them to enter a valid integer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. The game will tell you it's thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
3. Input your guess and press Enter.
4. Based on your guess, the game will let you know if your guess is too low or too high.
5. Keep guessing until you get the correct number.
6. Once you guess the number, the game will tell you how many attempts it took.
